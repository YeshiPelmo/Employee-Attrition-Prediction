Insights for Project2-Q1

Here are some insights you can draw from the "Key Features distributions by attrition" visualization:

Age: Employees who left ("Yes") tend to be younger compared to those who stayed ("No"). The attrition group has a higher frequency in the lower age range.

MonthlyIncome: Employees with lower monthly income are more likely to leave. The "Yes" group is concentrated at the lower end of the income scale.

DistanceFromHome: Employees who live farther from work show a slightly higher attrition, but the effect is not very strong.

YearsAtCompany and TotalWorkingYears: Employees with fewer years at the company or less total working experience are more likely to leave.

JobSatisfaction and WorkLifeBalance: Lower job satisfaction and work-life balance scores are associated with higher attrition.

PerformanceRating: There is little variation in performance rating, so it does not appear to be a strong differentiator for attrition in this dataset.

Summary:
Attrition is higher among younger, less experienced, lower-paid employees, and those with lower job satisfaction and work-life balance. These are key areas to focus on for retention strategies.
